## **<h1 align="center"> Refactoring VBA _code for stock Analysis**




  ## 1. Overview of Project: 
<p align="justify">Refactoring-code, means the process of restructuring code without changing the original functionality. The only motive of refactoring is to improve the logic by doing many small changes without altering external behavior of the code. Project_Analysis VBA file is is available in download link as below. <p>

## 2. Results: 
  
  ```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
  
<p align="justify">Basically Project is accomplished based on two technical analysis. Theater outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on Goals.<p>

### i) Year, 2017:
  
  ```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
<p align="justify">A “Pivot table” is created based on  "successful," "failed," and "canceled" outcomes.

## 3. Summary:
  <p align="justify">Though programmers and software developers refactor the code to improve the design, structure and implementation of software, besides advantages, it has disadvantages also.<p>
  
###   Advantages:
  - Almost all codes are available, no need to expedite whole thing.
  - Codes are well organized.
  - Helps to follow sequence. 
  - It helps to find bugs
  - Time saving



### Disadvantages:
  
  - Though the code is pre-defined, no scope to experiment how to start coding from the beginning.
  
  - It is not possible to know if there any bugs on it.
