  ## 1. Overview of Project: 
<p align="justify">The purpose of the project to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Analysis is performed to project the fundraise considering in a short amount of time.<p>
 <p align="justify">The project contains two technical analyses including tables and graphically visualization. Table and chart are created in MSExcel which is available in download link as below. <p>
  
  - [Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals](https://github.com/sharifbhuiyan/Kickstarter_analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip)  


## 2. Analysis and Challenges: 
<p align="justify">Basically Project is accomplished based on two technical analysis. Theater outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on Goals.<p>

### i) Theater outcomes based on launch date:
<p align="justify">A “Pivot table” is created based on  "successful," "failed," and "canceled" outcomes. 
A “Line with markers” chart has been created to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date. It visualizes the relationship between outcomes and launch month.

</p>

 

### ii)  Outcomes based on Goals :
<p align="justify">Spreasheet function is created to collect the outcomes and goals for the “plays” subcategory of dataset and calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each campaign.<p>

A line chart is created to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.

## 3. Final Outcomes from analysis:
 
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
  - From the analysis, it is cleared that the most successful month for Kickstarter campaigns was May.
  - <p align="justify">Jan, Mar, Sep, Nov and Dec all had almost the same number of failed campaigns launched. Though successful and failed outcomes of December showing almost in same point. <p>



### Outcomes based on Goals
<p align="justify">The 100% failed range was ‘45000 to 49999’, where number of total project was single. Though the highest number of successful in target range 1000 to 4999, which was 73%. But the highest successful rate 76% was in target range “Less than 1000”.<p>  



### some other possible tables and graphs that could be created
  
  - Clustered column chart can be created for showing Theater outcomes in “Y” axis and months in “X” axis.
  
  - Dataset has outliers. It can be demonstrated by creating a Box and Whisker Plot.
  
  - Measure of central tendency and measure of variation or dispersion can be used for skewed distributions or distributions with outliers.
